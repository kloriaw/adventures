      <description>Skyline was probably the hike that first led me to backpacking. I discovered it two years ago in 2016&amp;frasl;17 and since then, was obsessed with the thought of hiking it. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually done it, it feels strange! The weather was good, the views were great, the company was awesome, I packed my gear really well (light), the only thing that wassn&amp;rsquo;t good were my knees.

      <description>The First backpacking trip! There were some bear scares, and some other scares too, and I had no idea what I was doing most of the time. Still a wonderful weekend with many good memories made. I never actually made it up Mount Aylmer - the summit photos where taken by Chris.
