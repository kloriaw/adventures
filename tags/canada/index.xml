      <description>This was my attempt to squeeze in one last hike before the hiking season &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; ended. There had been a lot of snowfall in parts of Kananaskis but barely any in Lake Louise. Asking around resulted in various conflicting reports of avalanche and winter conditions. We decided to head out to the Lake Louise area and check the conditions out for ourselves. There was probably a foot of snow at higher elevations, but everything was otherwise very hikeable.</description>

      <description>Summer 2019 - I visited the east coast of Canada for the first time. Got some aggressive wetsuit tan lines. Also tried sailing, kayaking, canoeing, boogie boarding, and windsurfing for the first time. Collected lots of periwinkle shells. Watched the tides rise and fall every day. Ate a whole lobster.
