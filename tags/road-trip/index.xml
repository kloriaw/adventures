      <description>Canada Day road trip through Castle and Waterton park.
Date: 2018-06-30 to 2018-07-02
Location: Castle Provincal Park, Waterton National Park
Friends: Chris, and a caravan along the way
Drive to Castle We started off with the most scenic drive down Highway 533, then Highway 22 - also known as Cowboy Trail. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this highway has ever disappointed me with its views.
Castle Falls was a gorgeous and quiet campground, filled with the rushing sound of water from the nearby Castle Falls.</description>
