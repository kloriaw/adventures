The original plan was to do Larch Valley/Eiffel Peak/Sentinel Pass but we didn’t head out early enough to get a spot in the parking lot. Helen Lake/Cirque Peak was our backup and it turned out to be a delightful hike! The brief snow storm we encountered was magical rather than scary, and resulted in some stunning “winter” views. We didn’t end up attempting Cirque Peak since it was too snowy and it was getting late in the day.</h2>

                            <h2>What a summer this has been! Wonderful hikes, amazing weather, and so many great photos.
Mount Bourgeau (and Harvey Pass) might be my new favourite day hike. The approach was yet again very long and uneventful. After two hours, we arrived at Bourgeau Lake, which to me was a less awe-inspiring Rockbound Lake. Luckily, it was a short and easy climb past Bourgeau Lake to the spectacular Harvey Pass. Upon reaching the pass, I felt like I had arrived in some sort of paradise on earth: glacial lakes, lush green alpine meadows, fields of wildflowers, and crystal-clear streams, all surrounded by towering mountains.</h2>

                            <h2>Rockwall Trail is my new favourite backpacking trip. There was so much to love about this hike: stupendous views every day, great company, sunny and warm weather, wonderful campgrounds, endless fields of wildflowers, epic towering mountains and glaciers, and abundant streams, rivers, creeks, and waterfalls. On a personal note, the lack of knee pain (unlike last year) made the hike even more enjoyable.
My friends and I completed the hike North to South in three nights staying at Helmet Falls, Tumbling Creek, and Floe Lake, which I think was ideal in terms of pacing and daily distance/elevation gain.</h2>

Nihahi Ridge as a hike has never excited me but it turned out to be fun, especially the super-steep and slippery slopes, and the hands-on parts near the summit. We did not quite make it to the South summit but it was a good challenge.</h2>

The lake was constantly changing colours depending on the sunlight and clouds moving across the sky.
A hiking lesson I’ve learned: it’s always worth it to try getting above a lake if you can - the colours are so much better from above.</h2>
