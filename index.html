                            <h2>This was my attempt to squeeze in one last hike before the hiking season “officially” ended. There had been a lot of snowfall in parts of Kananaskis but barely any in Lake Louise. Asking around resulted in various conflicting reports of avalanche and winter conditions. We decided to head out to the Lake Louise area and check the conditions out for ourselves. There was probably a foot of snow at higher elevations, but everything was otherwise very hikeable.</h2>

Also tried sailing, kayaking, canoeing, boogie boarding, and windsurfing for the first time. Collected lots of periwinkle shells. Watched the tides rise and fall every day. Ate a whole lobster.

                            <h2>Skyline was probably the hike that first led me to backpacking. I discovered it two years ago in 2016⁄17 and since then, was obsessed with the thought of hiking it. Now that I’ve actually done it, it feels strange! The weather was good, the views were great, the company was awesome, I packed my gear really well (light), the only thing that wassn’t good were my knees.

Tried this hike last year and did not make it past West Wind Pass due to weather. Bit of easy scrambling/route finding after the pass. All trails eventually lead to the same place, and lots of people to follow if you get lost. Views of Spray Lake along the way are classic. All in all, my kind of hike!</h2>

No photos from the initial ascent, which was on a well-marked trail through forest.
Shortly after clearing the treeline, it gets a lot rockier and steeper. Miner’s Peak is right beside Ha Ling Peak. All these people taking different routes to the summit.</h2>
