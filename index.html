                            <h2>King’s Creek Ridge has an excellent effort-to-reward ratio, as can be seen from the photos. How lucky are Calgarians to see these views in the morning and still be home in time for lunch? The hike is very similar to Prairie Mountain in terms of length and elevation gain, but the views are out of the world for the amount of time you spend climbing. We ascended and descended via two different of well-worn trails.</h2>

                            <h2>One of the best feelings in the world is reaching a summit when you haven’t been outside in a while. The weather was nice and the rain at the trailhead turned into magical fluffy snowflakes a third of the way up. At the summit, any views were obstructed by fog. With the oppressive gloom pressing down around us, and the persistent drone of an airplane somewhere above, our time on the summit felt unsettling and eerie and somewhat post-apocalyptic.</h2>

                            <h2>This was my attempt to squeeze in one last hike before the hiking season “officially” ended. There had been a lot of snowfall in parts of Kananaskis but barely any in Lake Louise. Asking around resulted in various conflicting reports of avalanche and winter conditions. We decided to head out to the Lake Louise area and check the conditions out for ourselves. There was probably a foot of snow at higher elevations, but everything was otherwise very hikeable.</h2>

Now that I’ve actually done it, it feels strange! The weather was good, the views were great, the company was awesome, I packed my gear really well (light), the only thing that wassn’t good were my knees.

Tried this hike last year and did not make it past West Wind Pass due to weather. Bit of easy scrambling/route finding after the pass. All trails eventually lead to the same place, and lots of people to follow if you get lost. Views of Spray Lake along the way are classic. All in all, my kind of hike!</h2>
