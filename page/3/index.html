Drive to Castle We started off with the most scenic drive down Highway 533, then Highway 22 - also known as Cowboy Trail. I don’t think this highway has ever disappointed me with its views.
Castle Falls was a gorgeous and quiet campground, filled with the rushing sound of water from the nearby Castle Falls.</h2>

Despite the great weather and open views, this hike didn’t do it for me. Maybe it was the endless, unsatisfying ups and downs of the ridgewalk, or the unchanging views which got old after a few hours. We did not make it very far down the ridge before we turned back.</h2>
