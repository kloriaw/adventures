                            <h2>Summer 2019 - I visited the east coast of Canada for the first time. Developed some major wetsuit tan lines. Also tried sailing, kayaking, canoeing, boogie boarding, and windsurfing for the first time. Collected lots of periwinkle shells. Watched the tides rise and fall every day. Ate a whole lobster.

                            <h2>Skyline was probably the hike that first led me to backpacking. I discovered it two years ago in 2016⁄17 and since then, was obsessed with the thought of hiking it. Now that I’ve actually done it, it feels strange! The weather was good, the views were great, the company was awesome, I packed my gear really well (light), the only thing that wassn’t good were my knees.

                            <h2>Another “easy scramble” with high payoff. Nonstop views from the moment you get past treeline. Tried this hike last year and did not make it past West Wind Pass due to weather. Bit of easy scrambling/route finding after the pass. All trails eventually lead to the same place, and lots of people to follow if you get lost. Views of Spray Lake along the way are classic. All in all, my kind of hike!</h2>

An entire day of trudging up small rivers in the chilly gloom. By the time we made it to the pass, the sunlight and gorgeous sights cheered us up, but we decided to head back since everyone’s shoes were wet at that point.</h2>
