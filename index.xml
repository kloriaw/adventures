      <description>This was my attempt to squeeze in one last hike before the hiking season &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; ended. There had been a lot of snowfall in parts of Kananaskis but barely any in Lake Louise. Asking around resulted in various conflicting reports of avalanche and winter conditions. We decided to head out to the Lake Louise area and check the conditions out for ourselves. There was probably a foot of snow at higher elevations, but everything was otherwise very hikeable.</description>

      <description>Summer 2019 - I visited the east coast of Canada for the first time. Got some aggressive wetsuit tan lines. Also tried sailing, kayaking, canoeing, boogie boarding, and windsurfing for the first time. Collected lots of periwinkle shells. Watched the tides rise and fall every day. Ate a whole lobster.

      <title>Skyline Trail</title>

      <description>Skyline was probably the hike that first led me to backpacking. I discovered it two years ago in 2016&amp;frasl;17 and since then, was obsessed with the thought of hiking it. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually done it, it feels strange! The weather was good, the views were great, the company was awesome, I packed my gear really well (light), the only thing that wassn&amp;rsquo;t good were my knees.

      <description>Another &amp;ldquo;easy scramble&amp;rdquo; with high payoff. Nonstop views from the moment you get past treeline. Tried this hike last year and did not make it past West Wind Pass due to weather. Bit of easy scrambling/route finding after the pass. All trails eventually lead to the same place, and lots of people to follow if you get lost. Views of Spray Lake along the way are classic. All in all, my kind of hike!</description>

      <description>A casual hike right outside of Calgary. I’ve been wanting to hike Moose Mountain for a while now. It was a bluebird day and even though the annual Moose Mountain Trail Race was going on, we didn’t pass by many people – always a plus!

      <description>Short and super-popular. Steep going up with some scrambling at the top.
Date: 2017-08-19
Location: Kananaskis
Distance: 7 km
Elevation gain: 740 m
Time: 4 h, including some long breaks
Friends: Mario, Chris
No photos from the initial ascent, which was on a well-marked trail through forest.
Shortly after clearing the treeline, it gets a lot rockier and steeper. Miner’s Peak is right beside Ha Ling Peak. All these people taking different routes to the summit.</description>

      <description>A short and popular trail that also happened to be really pretty. Drove an hour and a half to Highwood Pass, the highest paved pass in Canada. It was 30 degrees in Calgary but felt about 17 up in the cirque because of the high elevation.
Date: 2017-07-25
Location: Kananaskis
Distance: 6.5 km (started scrambling up Mount Rae)
Elevation gain: 300 m

      <description>Could smell the smoke from the BC forest fires, even outside my house. It made for some interesting skies. Practiced my photography skills.
