      <description>This was my attempt to squeeze in one last hike before the hiking season &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; ended. There had been a lot of snowfall in parts of Kananaskis but barely any in Lake Louise. Asking around resulted in various conflicting reports of avalanche and winter conditions. We decided to head out to the Lake Louise area and check the condition out for ourselves. There was probably a foot of snow at higher elevations, but everything was otherwise very hikeable.</description>

      <description>Summer 2019, I visited the east coast of Canada for the first time. Got some aggressive wetsuit tan lines. Tried sailing, kayaking, canoeing, boogie boarding, and windsurfing for the first time. Collected lots of periwinkle shells. Watched the tides rise and fall every day. Ate a whole lobster.
Dates: 19-08-10 to 19-09-02

      <description>Skyline was probably the hike that started off my whole backpacking obsession. Discovered it two years ago in 2016&amp;frasl;17 and crazy that I actually got to do it. Weather was good. Gear packing was good. Knees were not good.

      <description>Another &amp;ldquo;easy scramble&amp;rdquo; with high payoff. Nonstop views from the moment you get past treeline. Tried this hike last year and did not make it past West Wind Pass due to weather. Bit of easy scrambling/route finding after the pass. All trails eventually lead to the same place, and lots of people to follow if you get lost. Views of Spray Lake along the way are classic. All in all, my kind of hike!</description>

      <description>A casual hike right outside of Calgary. I’ve been wanting to hike Moose Mountain for a while now. It was a bluebird day and even though the annual Moose Mountain Trail Race was going on, we didn’t pass by many people – always a plus!

Location: Kananaskis
Distance: 15 km
Elevation gain: 515 m
Time: 5 hours, including a one-hour lunch break
