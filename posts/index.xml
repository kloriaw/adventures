      <description>It always feels good to walk up a summit when you haven&amp;rsquo;t been outside in a while. The weather was nice and the rain at the trailhead turned into magical fluffy snowflakes a third of the way up. At the summit, any views were obstructed by fog. With the oppressive gloom pressing down around us, and the persistent drone of an airplane somewhere above, our time on the summit felt unsettling and eerie and somewhat post-apocalyptic.</description>

      <description>This was my attempt to squeeze in one last hike before the hiking season &amp;ldquo;officially&amp;rdquo; ended. There had been a lot of snowfall in parts of Kananaskis but barely any in Lake Louise. Asking around resulted in various conflicting reports of avalanche and winter conditions. We decided to head out to the Lake Louise area and check the conditions out for ourselves. There was probably a foot of snow at higher elevations, but everything was otherwise very hikeable.</description>

      <description>Summer 2019 - I visited the east coast of Canada for the first time. Got some aggressive wetsuit tan lines. Also tried sailing, kayaking, canoeing, boogie boarding, and windsurfing for the first time. Collected lots of periwinkle shells. Watched the tides rise and fall every day. Ate a whole lobster.

      <description>Skyline was probably the hike that first led me to backpacking. I discovered it two years ago in 2016&amp;frasl;17 and since then, was obsessed with the thought of hiking it. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually done it, it feels strange! The weather was good, the views were great, the company was awesome, I packed my gear really well (light), the only thing that wassn&amp;rsquo;t good were my knees.

      <description>Another &amp;ldquo;easy scramble&amp;rdquo; with high payoff. Nonstop views from the moment you get past treeline. Tried this hike last year and did not make it past West Wind Pass due to weather. Bit of easy scrambling/route finding after the pass. All trails eventually lead to the same place, and lots of people to follow if you get lost. Views of Spray Lake along the way are classic. All in all, my kind of hike!</description>

      <description>Between the gentle incline, pretty landscape, abundant fossils, and fields of whistling marmots, this was an enjoyable day hike. Unfortunately, the entire landscape was covered by a thick layer of wildfire smoke.

      <description>The First backpacking trip! There were some bear scares, and some other scares too, and I had no idea what I was doing most of the time. Still a wonderful weekend with many good memories made. I never actually made it up Mount Aylmer - the summit photos where taken by Chris.

      <description>Canada Day road trip through Castle and Waterton park.
Date: 2018-06-30 to 2018-07-02
Location: Castle Provincal Park, Waterton National Park
Friends: Chris, and a caravan along the way
Drive to Castle We started off with the most scenic drive down Highway 533, then Highway 22 - also known as Cowboy Trail. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this highway has ever disappointed me with its views.
Castle Falls was a gorgeous and quiet campground, filled with the rushing sound of water from the nearby Castle Falls.</description>

      <description>After walking down a riverbed for ten minutes, we realized that we were heading down the wrong trail and had to turn back to the parking lot. Despite the great weather and open views, this hike didn&amp;rsquo;t do it for me. Maybe it was the endless, unsatisfying ups and downs of the ridgewalk, or the unchanging views which got old after a few hours. We did not make it very far down the ridge before we turned back.</description>

      <description>Short and super-popular. Steep going up with some scrambling at the top.

Location: Kananaskis
Distance: 7 km
Elevation gain: 740 m
Time: 4 h, including some long breaks

No photos from the initial ascent, which was on a well-marked trail through forest.
Shortly after clearing the treeline, it gets a lot rockier and steeper.
Miner’s Peak is right beside Ha Ling Peak.
All these people taking different routes to the summit.</description>

      <description>A short and popular trail that also happened to be really pretty. Drove an hour and a half to Highwood Pass, the highest paved pass in Canada. It was 30 degrees in Calgary but felt about 17 up in the cirque because of the high elevation.
