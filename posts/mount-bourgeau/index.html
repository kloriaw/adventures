                    <p>What a summer this has been! Wonderful hikes, amazing weather, and so many great photos.</p>

<p>Mount Bourgeau (and Harvey Pass) might be my new favourite day hike. The approach was yet again very long and uneventful. After two hours, we arrived at Bourgeau Lake, which to me was a less awe-inspiring Rockbound Lake. Luckily, it was a short and easy climb past Bourgeau Lake to the spectacular Harvey Pass. Upon reaching the pass, I felt like I had arrived in some sort of paradise on earth: glacial lakes, lush green alpine meadows, fields of wildflowers, and crystal-clear streams, all surrounded by towering mountains. The lack of crowds on the trail added to the solitude and grandeur.</p>

<p>After Harvey Pass was the long yet straightforward climb up to the summit of Mount Bourgeau. We were hit with a freezing snow squall right as we reached the summit so we were unable to see any views of the peaks around us. The skies cleared up after five minutes but by that point, we were already halfway down the mountain!</p>

<p>I love how there is absolutely nothing technical about this hike and no exposure at any point. If you don&rsquo;t mind a long hike with a lot of elevation gain, the views along the way are worth it.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of the hike up to Bourgeau Lake was this waterfall and accompanying river crossing.</p>

<p>I was  excited to recognize the Healy Pass area! I&rsquo;ve been on top of one of those peaks&hellip;</p>

<p>An interesting perspective of the Sunshine ski-out and Goat&rsquo;s Eye mountain.</p>

<p>I think all the faint lines through the scree are sheep trails heading up to Harvey Pass.</p>
