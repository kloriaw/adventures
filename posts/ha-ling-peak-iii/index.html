                    <p>My first sunrise hike and it had to be a winter one. I was itching to get out after staying at home for too long. I decided that this would be a safe and easy objective and my hunch was correct. The third return to the well-trod Ha Ling. Getting up early helps avoid the crowds, although we still encountered a few groups at the summit.We started hiking in the dark at 6 am and made it to the summit just before sunrise. I overestimated my ability to bound up the last grind at the end and found myself huffing and puffing my way up there, as usual. I found it really easy to hike up in the dark with ultra-bright headlamps and microspikes - the trail was packed solid on the way up and mostly bare at the summit. My hands and feet froze for the half an hour we stayed at the summit&hellip;handwarmers were a lifesaver but my feet went painfully numb.</p>

<p>We were blessed with a beautiful sunrise, which made everything worth it. Not to say the hike was wasn&rsquo;t fun on its own merit, although waking up at 4 am was definitely the most painful part of the experience. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the brightening up of the skies prior to sunrise, just a tinge of lighter washed out blue on the horizon at first, then more and more snow-covered peaks appearing before me, somehow appearing both tack-sharp and watery. We broke through the treeline in time to be greeted by that mysterious presence known as blue hour. Being dwarfed/surrounded by giants while bathed in that pre-dawn half-light, was more humbling and magical than the actual sunrise that followed. It wasn&rsquo;t the dazzling pastel hues exploding on the horizon that will stick with me (although that was quite a beautiful sight on its won), but the Brisk stillness, embodying the awakening of the whole world around you. The feeling of being on top of a mountain as the sun rises is indescribable.</p>
