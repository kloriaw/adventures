<h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>

<ul>
<li>drove out to Jasper Friday afternoon, first time driving Icefields pkwy for years</li>
</ul>

<p>- Saskatchewan crossing good mid resting spot</p>

<p>- so many good resting/view spots all along the way on both sides of the road</p>

<p>- filled up on gas in Jasper, probably could have made it there and back without filling up if thrifty</p>

<p>- Wapiti campground big and good facilities but very little privacy - trees all dead or fallen</p>

<p>- also couldn&rsquo;t seem to find potable water or water dump/sink washing station there, other than holes for RV sewage dump</p>

<p>- showers/flush bathrooms were really nice</p>

<p>drove home on afternoon of third day rather than staying at Wapiti for another night, since our hike out was so short</p>

<p>## The hike</p>

<p>- Minimum 3 days, second day too long, painful, best views were all on second day, third day too short</p>

<p>- doing trail opposite way (Signal to Maligne Lake) was great</p>

<p>- parking at Signal was crowded, take shuttle or get early or have backup (other than parking on shoulder). Lesson learned from three dudes.</p>

<p>- muddy campsites</p>

<p>- gaiters not needed despite hikers passing by asking us incredulously &ldquo;where are your gaiters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>- mosquito net not needed but would have greatly improved quality of life</p>

<p>- natural mosquito spray would have been nice rather than stinky stuff</p>

<p>- Be prepared for mosquitoes - doable but could make life a lot better with right gear (head nets, long sleeves/pants, repellent). Mosquitoes disappeared above treeline and when it was raining (wished it rained more cause no mosquitoes)</p>

<p>- to beat mosquitoes, head to bed early and wake up before <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> while they are still asleep</p>

<p>- mastered the art of quickly runing inside tent to let minimal amount of mosquitoes inside</p>

<p>- Trail was fairly muddy most of the way despite not seeing much rain, gaiters would have helped but more important would be waterproof shoes/extra shoes</p>

<h2 id="packing-gear">Packing/gear</h2>

<p>- did not pack ___, was okay (jacket, shoes, pack cover, &hellip;)</p>

<p>-</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-summary-overall">Conclusion/Summary/overall</h1>

<p>Nice to check off a bucket list hike. So sore and dirty feeling that I was done with hiking and the outdoors for the season, it felt like. (Little did I know that the outdoors urge would strike again in September). Very lucky with the weather and probably got away with packing that I shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to. Views were terrific. Lots of skeeters. More wet and buggy than normal for this time of year? Later summer season? Pretty popular trail but not all campsites were full each night, especially at less popular ones?</p>
