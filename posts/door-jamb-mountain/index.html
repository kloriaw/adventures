                    <p>Let me tell you about the adventure that was my first solo hike. Door Jamb Mountain is a great hike for a number of reasons: it&rsquo;s less than an hour drive from my house, it&rsquo;s not well-known so there aren&rsquo;t crowds of people to navigate, there&rsquo;s a bunch of fun hands-on no-consequence scrambling since half of the hike involves an easy climb along a ridge, there are lots of chances to exercise your route finding skills since much of the hike doesn&rsquo;t have a defined trail, there are technically two summits to bag if you go further up to Loder Peak, and the orientation and location of the peak make it a great snow-free option for early or late in the season.</p>

<p>This wonderful hike ended turning a bit of a nightmare with me fearing for my survival a few times. Admittedly, my mountain senses need calibration&hellip;I also feared I was going to die during my first ever hike (Tent Ridge) when my parents and I went off trail and bushwhacked up the mountain via a scree slope. In retrospect, it was a pretty tame situation so I can&rsquo;t say I trust my judgment when it comes to life-or-death situations in the mountains, but this was far from my first hike and one section in particular felt way beyond my abilities.</p>

<p>Somewhere around three quarters of the way up, I found myself clinging onto a nearly vertical sheet of rock sloping into the abyss&hellip;twice (since I went the same way going up and down). The angle of the wall must have been 35 or 40 degrees, and it went a long down with the bottom ending in a sheer drop to the valley below.  Convinced that a fall would have resulted in my death, I half crawled, half dragged myself up and down that cursed slope, which was not cool considering I&rsquo;m pretty sure everyone people either walked down it or around it. By the time I made it up to the summit of Door Jamb Mountain, I was too freaked out to continue towards Loder Peak or even enjoy the summit much, although the trail up Loder Peak looked like a nice walk and everyone else was doing it, including a large group of middle-aged Japanese ladies.</p>

<p>That same group of middle-aged Japanese ladies ahead of me didn&rsquo;t seem to have any trouble with the hike, which makes me think I was either an idiot who couldn&rsquo;t find the correct trail from either direction, or a wimp who needed to buckle down and just walk down the damn thing!</p>

<p>Door Jamb Mountain was certainly a memorable hike. One of the few experiences I&rsquo;ve had that I&rsquo;d rate type 3 fun, or maybe 2.5 since I only 99% regret doing it.</p>

<p>Not-so-lovely view of the Graymount Exshaw limestone plant heading up. Fortunately, the industrial sights and noises disappeared pretty quickly after I started ascending.</p>

<p>There was some sort of helicopter rescue training going on in the parking lot near the trailhead.</p>

<p>I cried. It was scary. The way down wasn&rsquo;t much better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;IF YOU FALL, YOU DIE!!!&rdquo; - my brain the whole time.</p>

<p>My nemesis looking foreboding from the parking lot.</p>

<p>Some other silver linings - the views were good and Door Jamb is a cool little summit I will see every time I head west on Highway 1.</p>
