                    <p>Kat and I attempted Nihahi Ridge while Greg and Chris biked the Elbow loop. This turned out to be a great idea. We were also trying to take it easy the weekend before our big trip.</p>

<p>Nihahi Ridge as a hike has never excited me but it turned out to be fun, especially the super-steep and slippery slopes, and the hands-on parts near the summit. We did not quite make it to the South summit but it was a good challenge.</p>

<p><strong>Date</strong>: 2020-07-26</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong>: Kananaskis</p>

<p><strong>Friends</strong>: Kat</p>

<p>It was too hot and sunny to enjoy these meadows. We were granted a nice view of the ridge that we planned to climb though.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9385.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The end of the official hiking trail. It got steeper after this.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9391.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9396.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We must have come up this way.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9419.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Feeling good after we made it past the first scrambly bit.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9424.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9428.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think we could have made it to the official South summit but we were both content to turn back at this point and leave it as a challenge for next time.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9439.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The full extent of the ridge&hellip;looked like a slog!</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9452.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The descent, where there was much butt-scooting and crab-walking.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9472.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This &ldquo;easy&rdquo; scramble section made me nervous but it wasn&rsquo;t as scary as it looked. Hopefully it feels better the next time I do this.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/002_9497.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Back to the refreshingly icy Elbow River. We finished within 15 minutes of the boys so the timing was good.</p>
